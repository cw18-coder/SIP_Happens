## Matching Funds to Your Life's User Stories

### Short Term (1-3 years) – "Sprint Goals"

- **Fund Categories:** Hybrid funds, Conservative hybrid funds, Balanced advantage funds
- **Analogy:** Like choosing React over the latest JavaScript framework – proven, reliable, with room for growth.
- **Why Balanced?** Medium-term goals need growth to beat inflation but also stability to ensure the money is there when you need it.

### Long Term (7+ years) – "Platform Building"
- **Examples:** Retirement, Wealth creation
- **Risk:** Aggressive
- **Returns:** 12-15%
- **Fund Categories:** Equity funds, Index funds, International funds
