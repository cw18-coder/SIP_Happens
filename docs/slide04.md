# The Three Points Framework
## Goal-Time-Risk: The Holy Trinity of Investment

Just like the classic trade-off triangle in project management (Fast, Good, Cheap - pick two), investing has its own triangle. With proper planning and time, you can optimize for all three.

- 🎯 **GOALS**: What you're building (feature requirements)
- ⏰ **TIME HORIZON**: Your delivery timeline (sprint duration)
- 🎲 **RISK APPETITE**: Your tolerance for bugs (volatility in returns)

#### Why This Triangle Matters
Understanding this triangle is crucial because it determines your entire investment architecture. A short-term goal with high risk tolerance makes no sense, just like trying to build a complex feature with a one-day deadline makes no sense.
